                <li>Go to the game website and click on the start button.</li>
                <li>The game will randomly generate a text on the top of the page. For example, “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”</li>
                <li>The first player clicks on the start button to begin the voice recognition. The player has 15 seconds to say as many words as possible that are related to the text. For example, “fox, dog, jump, animal, fur, tail, etc.”</li>
                <li>The game will count the number of words the player says and display them on the screen.</li>
                <li>The first player clicks on the stop button to end the voice recognition.</li>
                <li>The second player repeats steps 2 to 5, using the same text as the first player.</li>
                <li>The game will compare the number of words each player said and declare the winner. The winner is the player who said the most words. If there is a tie, the game will generate a new text and the players will play again.</li>
                <li>The players can play as many rounds as they want, using different texts each time.</li>
